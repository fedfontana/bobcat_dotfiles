- Colorscheme:
  - find darker colorscheme (something like ayu-dark or NVChad Yoru)
  - find a light colorscheme

1. write the `gbr` alias as a vim cmd/shortcut
2. change dressing theme to use telescope instead of fzf for vim.select
3. change load events for stuff. More stuff can be VeryLazy (does the "Lazy" event exist). Some, like colorizer, may only need to be loaded on certain file types
