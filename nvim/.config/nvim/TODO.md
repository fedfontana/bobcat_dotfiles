- Colorscheme:
  - find darker colorscheme (something like ayu-dark or the NVChad Yoru)
  - find a light colorscheme
  - add some telescope keymap to change the theme
- lualine changes:
  - highlight normal mode in the bottom right in some other color maybe
  - make it so that the center of the line does not change color to a brighter one when changing to modes != normal

1. write the `gbr` alias as a vim cmd/shortcut
2. change dressing theme?
   - use telescope instead of fzf for vim select
3. change load events for stuff. More stuff can be VeryLazy (does the "Lazy" event exist). Some, like colorizer, may only need to be loaded on certain file types
